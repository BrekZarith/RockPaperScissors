This is a small exercice from the Odin Project. Rock Paper Scissors is played from the console only.

Rock Paper Scissors is run through the function called game. Within that function, the function called playRound is called 5 times. The function game keeps scores and declares a winner after the 5 rounds.

I used prompt for user input and Math.floor(Math.random()*3) for computer input.
